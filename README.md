# Extreme Color Mixing

Have you hear of Extreme Ironing? Get ready for Extreme Color Mixing!

You are a biker that is tasked with blending a specific color, but competing bikers have put an assortment of deadly traps before you! Will make the sweet sweet slightly red bluish color, or will you be splatter on the ground along with you bike?

Controller is strongly recommended.

W, A, S, D or arrows or left stick to move.
Space or controller A button to boost (if you don't have an A button, just mash around on your controller, you will probably find the right button).


The soundtrack released on [youtube](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3FOLwve3sKU).
